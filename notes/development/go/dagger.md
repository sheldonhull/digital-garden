[Containerized magic with Go and BuildKit](https://dagger.io?ref=sheldonhull.com)

Will put some experience notes here soon as I've successfully built angular and nginx containers with it and overall was a great experience.
With the upcoming services support, I can see a whole lot more usage cases too.
