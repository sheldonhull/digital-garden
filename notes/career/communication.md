!!! quote "Selling Past the Close"

    > "Don't sell past the close" simply means that, once the customer has agreed to the points being made, the person or team making the pitch should immediately move onto the next aspect of the deal. [Don't sell past the close][dont-sell-past-the-close]

    This is great, as I've found trying to win someone and finally having a concession can result in continuing the "sell" beyond.
    In an effort to convince, it's important to ensure you accept a close and move on.

!!! quote "Reflective Listening[^Help Your Boss Help You]"

    The skill of reflective listening involves two steps:

    Understand what the speaker is saying, and then repeat it back to them to confirm you understood it correctly.
